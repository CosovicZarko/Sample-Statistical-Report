# Sample-Statistical-Report
This is one of the statistical reports I was hired to do, and it reports on the study of eczema relief cream. The study compared two different brands. This project's tables, analysis, and the graphs were all created from scratch, and according to the specific requirements for this particular report. It involved R programming as well as multiple packages, and Microsoft Word.
